A MapReduce implementation in x10

Milestone 1 notes: Performant serial implementation

 - We restrict our input type to a one dimensional array of values.
 - We take a tree based approach to implementing MapReduce. Our serial 
   implementation recursively divides the input array in half, until it reaches
   the leave level.
 - This tree based implementation was chosen with reusability in mind. Our future
   parallel version of this project will divide the input array into portions,
   and call the sequential version on each portion.
